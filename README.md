Data mining is the process of extracting hidden patterns and insights from a vast amount of unstructured data collected from different sources. As data mining is a crucial step in the data science pipeline, I am interested in learning about data mining.

This book provides a detailed view of tools, techniques, and algorithms to handle big data. The three authors of this book delve into concepts such as Googleâ€™s PageRank, map-reduce, clustering and dimensionality reduction algorithms, latent semantic indexing, and more. These concepts facilitate the mining of big datasets with ease. The authors beautifully explain recommendation systems with an example: "Offering news articles to online newspaper readers based on a prediction of reader interests." They delve into topics such as content-based recommendations, collaborative filtering, and the changes at Netflix. All these discussions by the authors have piqued my interest and motivated me to explore this book in detail.
